# Ciphers-and-code-breaking
A collection of various simple ciphers/codes and relevant breakers

These include ciphers ranging from the simple Caesar cipher, to more complex ciphers like the transpostion cipher.
This cipher relies on a 'detect english' program to alert the user when a key has been found that resembles English.
It will brute force keys and when one is found with a certain % of english, it pauses to let the user determine accuracy as shown 
in the picture below.

This is an ongoing repository and I am current working on making substituion ciphers and breakers.
